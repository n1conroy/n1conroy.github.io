With a PhD and MLIS, I combine library science principles with 8+ years of data science and machine learning experience.

Iâ€™ve worked in both public institutions and tech companies, and I now focus on helping libraries adopt AI tools that align with their values: equitable access, informed communities, and responsible innovation.
