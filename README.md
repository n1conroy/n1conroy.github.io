## About

With a PhD and MLIS, I bring over 10 years of experience managing large-scale data systems in industry, alongside a foundational background in library science and public service. As a former librarian and researcher, I understand both the mission and the operational realities of library work.

I now focus on helping libraries make practical, sustainable decisions around integrating artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs), and intelligent workflows into both patron-facing services and internal operations.

My work is grounded in strategic alignment, budget awareness, and implementation that respects public trust and staffing constraints.

## Why Now?

Libraries are facing a fundamental shift in how people search for, evaluate, and engage with information. As generative tools and LLMs reshape public expectations, libraries must decide whether to react or lead.

By taking strategic steps now—rooted in ethics, access, and transparency—libraries can ensure they remain essential public institutions in the age of AI.
